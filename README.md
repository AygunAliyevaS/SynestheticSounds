Round Brush → Pure sine wave (clean tone). 
Square Brush → Square wave (harsh, digital tone). 
Star Brush → Adds a harmonic at twice the frequency, giving a richer sound. 
Triangle Brush → Triangle wave (soft and mellow). 
Cross Brush → Adds a detuned frequency, creating a beating effect. 
Sawtooth Brush → Sawtooth wave (bright, buzzy tone). 
Spray Brush → Rounded saw (complex, textured tone) Sine wave with random frequency variation, creating a slightly warbled effect.
